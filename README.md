Breathe is an innovative  mental peace web app that targets people who are suffering from mental health issues like depression and anxiety developed on java Spring Boot framework as the backend and javascript, html, and css as the front end. 
The project focuses on providing an easy and accessible platform to track daily mood and logging it in a secure web app.

As soon as the home page loads, a user has options to choose mood based on how they feel by choosing from the emoji , choose an emoji based on the userâ€™s mood. 
The user has options to choose worried,  sad, anxious, happy, and joyful. The user can log their mood entry and check-in.. After checking in, a user will be able to see a message display on the screen to inspire and motivate them.       
The tools and technologies used are Java Development Kit(JDK),Spring Boot, Intellij IDEA, Spring MVC, Maven, MySql,and Hibernate.
